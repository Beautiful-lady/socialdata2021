    "We can't be sure how long the current lock-down will last. \n",

    "For that reason, I have designed the class in such a way that \n",
    "\n",
    "* **It will always possible to follow the class without showing up**. All important information, including introductory lectures will be available online - on the course website. \n",
    "* Thus, even if teaching in person resumes, if you'd like, you don't have to come.\n",
    "* If/When we open DTU back up, I have detailed plans for how to run the course in the safest way possible, including physical presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the class is already set up, it works well for online-only teaching (see \"How to take this class for details\"), but we need new ways of interacting with the TAs and yours truly. Those are explained below. "

    "* *Exercises and assignments*. Most of the questions you have about the material during the lectures should also be asked on Slack, but not in in the #general channel. Instad, I'll be starting a channel for each lecture, eg. `#lecture1_questions` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I like to use Slack for most questions is that they'll be there permanently. \n",

    "\n",
    "For those times, we will use Zoom. It'll work in the following way. Each week, we will spin up a zoom meeting per TA (and for me) that you can access to ask questions. Links will be posted on slack -- in the general channels. There'll always be at least one TA available on Zoom."
